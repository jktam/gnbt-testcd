# GNBT
This is a multifunctional, quality of life discord bot that currently has the following functions:

1. Track packages

## Setup
1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to download all the packages needed for this bot.
2. Create a file `auth.json` and place is at the root of the directory. The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "token": "<DISCORD_TOKEN>",
  "upsUser": "<UPS_USER_EMAIL>",
  "upsPass": "<UPS_USER_PASSWORD>",
  "upsServiceAccessToken": "<UPS_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
}
```
3. Run `node bot.js` to run the bot on your Discord server.
4. (Add more instructions after we get an actual server up)
